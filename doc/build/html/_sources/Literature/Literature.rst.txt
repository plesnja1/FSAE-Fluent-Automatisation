Fluid Dynamics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An intimate knowledge of fluid dynamics is an essential tool in race car aerodynamicists toolkit. It allows us to predict the fluid flow behavior based on involved geometry
and to correctly interpret the results provided by computational toold.

An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
“An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics” by G. K. Batchelor remains a classic fluid mechanics book that addresses the theories of 
this field in an elegant manner. Though published in 1960’s, this timeless classic still holds a reader’s attention.

Fluid Mechanics: An Intermediate Approach
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
If you’re looking to delve deeper into more advanced material, “Fluid Mechanics: An Intermediate Approach” by Bijay K. 
Sultanian takes a practical rather than purely theoretical approach. 
A variety of illustrative examples provide context to the subject matter and help navigate the reader through a broad range of topics.



CFD theory
^^^^^^^^^^
Literature for robust knowledge of theory behind CFD solvers. While not necesary for handling of commercial software, it provides useful knowledge of its limitations and 
posibilities. After sufitiently learning the texts bellow, you should be able to create zour own simple 2D CFD solver. 

Introduction To Computational Fluid Dynamics
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This book seeks to present all the fundamental material needed for good 
simulation of fluid flows by means of the finite volume method, and is split
into three parts. The first part, consisting of Chapters 2 and 3, is concerned
with the fundamentals of fluid flows in three dimensions and turbulence.
Chapter 3 represents the development of the concepts of turbulence that are necessary for a full appreciation of the finer details of CFD in many engineering applications.
The second part of the book is devoted to the numerical algorithms of 
the finite volume method and covers Chapters 4 to 9. Discretisation schemes
and solution procedures for steady flows are discussed in Chapters 4 to 7.

Metoda Konečných Objemů I, II (CZ)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Skripta pro předmět Metoda Konečných Objemů vyučovaný panem Profesorem Fürstem. První skripta pojednávají o odvození MKO, definici a odvození jednotlivých diskretizačních
schémat a určení jejich přesnosti a stability. Ke konci této knihy by student měl být schopný vytvořit vlastní 1D až 2D EXPLICITNÍ CFD řešič a znát 
rozdíly, výhody a limitace jednotlivých schémat.

Druhá skripta pojednávají o algoritmech pro tvorbu sítě, diskretizaci konvektivních, difusivních a diferenciálních operátorů v diferenciálních rovnicích a jejich 
maticové vyjídření. Ve výsledku by tyto skripta měla předat znalosti potřebné k tvorbě a pochopení IMPLICITNÍHO CFD řešiče.

Notes on Computational Fluid Dynamics: General Principles
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Notes on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was written for people who use CFD in their work, research or study, 
providing essential knowledge to perform CFD analysis with confidence. It offers a modern perspective on CFD with the finite volume method, 
as implemented in OpenFOAM and other popular general-purpose CFD software. Fluid dynamics, turbulence modelling and boundary conditions are presented 
alongside the numerical methods and algorithms in a series of short, digestible topics, or notes, that contain complete, concise and relevant information.

Internal Flows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Wether it is for cooling ducts and fans or inner structures of motor cooling, internal flows are quiet different from structures of external flow.
Bellow is some literature that should aid in designing such features.

Handbook of Hydraulic Resistance
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
No matter how weird shape of your tubing, chances are that someone has already meassured its effect on your flow. In this case it was the russians during the cold war.
Nevertheless this knowledge is still relevant for designing of inner flow structures and understanding how they affect the resistance of the flow.

VDI Heat Atlas
""""""""""""""
The VDI-Wa ¨rmeatlas or VDI Heat Atlas has a long-lasting history and it can be considered as a standard book for heat exchanger
and process engineering equipment design. It is not conceived as a textbook presenting an overall view of the theoretical or
experimental findings in heat transfer sciences. The aim was and is to present and explain the state of the art of engineering methods
to solve industrially relevant heat transfer problems for apparatus design and process modeling.

Fan Handbook
""""""""""""
A guide to various aspects of modern fan technology. It takes you through the design, selection, maintenance, and repair of fans used 
in a range of applications and industries, including airfoils; centrifugal fans; mixed-flow fans; roof ventilators; cross-flow blowers; regenerative blowers; and, more.

Car Aerodynamics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Car aerodynamics is in itself a large and still developing area. Hundreds of engineers before have already tried many concepts to reduce drag and increase downforce.
Few of them took their years of practise and wrote them into some helpfull literature.

Race Car Aerodynamics
"""""""""""""""""""""
Race Car Aerodynamics is the first book to summarize the secrets of the rapidly developing field of high-speed vehicle design. 
Over the past 15 years, author Joseph Katz has been involved with aerodynamic development in the most competitive areas of motorsport today. 
From Formula One, to Indy Car, Drag and Sedan Racing, this book provides clear explanations for both engineers who want to improve their design skills,
 and enthusiasts who want to understand how their favorite cars go fast.
